# Indas Meal Tracking Automation-ASPNETCore-EntityFramework

## Overview
This project is the back-end solution of the "Meal Tracking Automation" software that I developed for Indas Group, during my internship.
The aim of the project is to provide practical and efficient lunch menu selection process for the employees within the company.
This Web API, which is actively running on the company's server, provides the necessary functionality by communicating with the company's local MSSQL database system via "Entity Framework".

JWT (RFC 7519) mechanism was included to the project in order to provide prevention for unauthorized users from accessing the functions in the system.
